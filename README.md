Second Checkpoint:

We currently have a small playable demo where you start off as a character in a map.
This map has an exit on the right side which takes you to a new map with an enemy.
These maps are built using the TileSystem.

Additionally, there is a black fog-like area you can find in the top right of the maps.
This is just to show our lighting/fog-of-war system which we plan to polish up in future weeks.

The bulk of our engine features for points are done, and we mostly will work on polishing up
these engine features and potentially adding a couple more like dialogue as we work more on 
our game.

Our goal for next week is to have a much more finished and playable game that will be more
interesting for playtesters and isn't just a map or two with not much to interact with.


- Tile System
    - Most Related code is in the TileSystem folder under engine/finalGame/
    - Testing code is in projects/final_project
- Sound Engine
    - Related code is in the Audio Component
    - testing code is in projects/WizTesting/
- Lighting System
    - Most of the related code is in the engine/game/components in the DrawFogComponent and 
    LightComponent classes.
    - There is also some code in engine/game/systems/LightingSystem

First CheckPoint:

Nothing Playable just yet.

- Tile System
    - Most Related code is in the TileSystem folder under engine/finalGame/
    - Testing code is in projects/final_project
- Sound Engine
    - Related code is in the Audio Component
    - testing code is in projects/WizTesting/
    
There are more features that will be added but we can say we are mostly done (close to the point requirement)
