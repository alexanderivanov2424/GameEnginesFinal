Found various bugs that are now fixed.
Coin pickup is a little finicky(probably wont be fixed)

Alex Playtest 2: Mom
Good design, nice colors, interesting movements through not a completely flat world.
Stumps don't do anything but look like they should.
Can't see behind trees.
Better Dialog.
Finish later levels.

Wanted some more interactable things in the first area, felt like the game looked a lot better but
still lacked interactable content. Also was confused by the keys needed to be pressed to advance dialogue.
Found an edge case where an enemy could push the player through the wall. Commented that stopping when attacking
felt a little clunky.

Miru Playtest 2: Sister with moderate gaming experience
My sister also seemed to struggle a bit with the controls for dialogue as well, and was a little confused as to
the game's direction and what exactly to do. There should definitely be more clear instructions/indicators
in the actual game. Additionally, commented that she liked the decoration we did.

Apart from comments about graphics the subject seemed pretty satisfied by the game. Perhaps we could
tweak walking animations to make it look more natural. There was a comment that the character felt slow,
but that may be due to us having a large world with nothing to interact with. Otherwise, they were excited to
see what else could be done with a more polished game and more things to interact with.

The main feedback I got from my sister was that the "evil boss was not very scary." Other than that, I noticed
that she had a slightly hard time figuring what walls were and what places were accessible or not. It's hard to tell
if this is because of a lack of gaming experience, or a lack of clarity on our part, as it seems pretty clear to
me and my other playtester. Additionally, she couldn't figure out that you could hold down space bar to continuously
attack, so perhaps that could be more explicitly stated.
