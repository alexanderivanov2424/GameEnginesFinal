Miru Playtest 1: Friend with extraordinary gaming experience

Apart from comments about graphics the subject seemed pretty satisfied by the game. Perhaps we could
tweak walking animations to make it look more natural. There was a comment that the character felt slow,
but that may be due to us having a large world with nothing to interact with. Otherwise, they were excited to
see what else could be done with a more polished game and more things to interact with.

Miru Playtest 2: Sister with moderate gaming experience

The main feedback I got from my sister was that the "evil boss was not very scary." Other than that, I noticed
that she had a slightly hard time figuring what walls were and what places were accessible or not. It's hard to tell
if this is because of a lack of gaming experience, or a lack of clarity on our part, as it seems pretty clear to
me and my other playtester. Additionally, she couldn't figure out that you could hold down space bar to continuously
attack, so perhaps that could be more explicitly stated.
