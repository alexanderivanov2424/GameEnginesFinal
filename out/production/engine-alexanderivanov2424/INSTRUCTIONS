Tell us how to play your game in this file.


Run the Main class in the nin project. This will take you to the mainScreen.
From here click the start button to progress to the gameScreen.

On the game screen:
Use A and D to move left and right and SPACE to jump.
Click and hold to fire a lazer beam in the direction of the mouse.
The lazer will be able to push rocks and to break them after about 3 seconds.

Scrolling can be used to zoom out and see the whole level.
This is used to verify the dynamic spawning but would otherwise not be in the game.

There are different rock piles with different restitutions plaed randomly across the level.

There is also a platform with a bump in it. This is achieved through a polygonal collision shape.

There are buttons on the left side that let you restart the game, return to the main menu, save the current game state,
and load back the last save that was made.
